v1.6
- Added a SHOW_BERRYDEX_IN_PAUSE_MENU setting to provide a way to make the BerryDex appear in the vanilla pause menu (since I've been asked for this many times).
- Added a REQUIRE_BERRYDEX_BEFORE_REGISTRATION setting to allow defining whether or not berries you pick before receiving the BerryDex will appear registered when you receive it.
- Added a BERRY_MUTATION_HIDE_UNREGISTERED setting to allow only showing berries you have registered in the BerryDex while viewing the mutations page.
- Added changes to support Preferred Soil (requires Berry Planting Improvements).

v1.5.1
- Actually alias the deprecation suppression correctly to prevent crashes.

v1.5
- New feature: Added function pbBerryGetNaturalGift to check a Berry's Natural Gift data directly.
- New feature: Added a paramter to pbChooseBerryMultiple to allow showing different labels when selecting a Berry. For example, you can either things like the Berry's color, size, or Natural Gift type.
- Started the process of being fully v21 compatible.
-- Note: Compiling berry_data PBS file is not yet converted. I added a bit of code to suppress the warning that appears every compile in the meantime.
- Made some changes to pbChooseBerryMultiple to have text that fits the count of berries.


v1.4
- New feature: Berrydex Battle page. This page will show information pertaining to battles, like the Fling power, Natural Gift type and Power, and effect when used in battle. By default, the item description for the berry will show as the "effect when used in battle" portion. However, not all descriptions would fit this. You can customize what description to show here by including a BattleDescription for the berry in the berry_data.txt to show that, instead.
- Added the option to show a berry's color in the Tag Page of the Berrydex.
- Fixed an issue where the wrong color could be shown in the scene where you choose multiple berries.
- Fixed crashes in the Berrydex when you turn off BERRYDEX_MUTATIONS_PAGE.
- Fixed an issue where BERRYDEX_SHOW_NUMBER wasn't respected in the Berrydex entries.

v1.3
- Added a new setting BERRYDEX_SHOW_ENTIRE_LIST. Setting this to true will show the entire list of potential berries from the start, instead of only showing up through a berry that is registered. For instance, if you have 60 berries defined in the dex, but you only have berry #2 registered, instead of showing #1 as unregistered and #2 as registered, it would show all 60 in the list, with unregistered berries still appearingunregistered.
-- Note: This also makes it so the player can view the Berrydex without having any berries registered! It will just show an empty list.
- Added new function pbUnregisterBerry
- Updated BerryColorData to use Color.new instead of the rgbToColor function

v1.2
- New feature: Mutation Data page in the Berry Dex (requires Berry Planting Improvements)
- New feature: Tag page in the Berry Dex can now show the flavor of a berry in Pentagon Graph form (requires Marin's Better Bitmaps)
- Fixed the name of the GANLONBERRY Tag Icon

v1.1
- New feature: pbChooseBerryMultiple, a command with a custom scene to choose multiple berries at once.
- Added infrustructure for Preferred Zones (which comes with Berry Planting Improvements)
- Added handling to prevent a crash when opening the Berrydex in a save file created from before plugin installation. 

v1.0
- Initial Release
